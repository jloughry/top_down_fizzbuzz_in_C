# top_down_fizzbuzz_in_C

I don't know why I was thinking about this problem but I was. This is how I
would solve Fizzbuzz in a top down manner, in C. The C language is not ideal
for this task, as passing strings around is not so easy, and I would have
preferred to use automated tests. But assert() is cool.
